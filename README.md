# TICTACTOE
Java based
game of tic-tac-toe
A board game (such as Tic-tac-toe) is typically programmed as a state machine. Depending on the current-state and the player's move, the game transits into the next-state. In this example, I use a variable currentState to keep track of the current-state of the game, and define named constants to denote the various states of the game (PLAYING, DRAW, CROSS_WON, and NOUGHT_WON).  A method called stepGame() is defined, which will be called to transit into next state.
